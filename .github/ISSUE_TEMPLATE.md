### Disclaimer

The xPack OpenOCD is only a binary distribution of the standard source code
OpenOCD, and does not intend to add new functionality, or to fix existing
problems.

If you have questions/suggestions related to the procedure used to
build/publish the binary distribution, continue reading the next sections.

If you have problems related to OpenOCD functionality, please use the
official [OpenOCD support channels](https://openocd.org/discussion/).
