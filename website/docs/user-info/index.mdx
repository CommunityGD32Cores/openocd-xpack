{/* ------------------------------------------------------------------------ */}

This page is intended for those who plan
to use the OpenOCD binaries in their workflows.

## Versioning

The version string used by the OpenOCD project is a three number string
like <code>{ siteConfig.customFields.upstreamVersion }</code>; to this string the xPack distribution adds a four number,
but since semver allows only three numbers, all additional ones can
be added only as pre-release strings, separated by a dash,
like <code>{ siteConfig.customFields.upstreamVersion }-{ siteConfig.customFields.xpackSubversion }</code>. When published as a npm package, the version gets
a fifth number, like <code>{ siteConfig.customFields.upstreamVersion }-{ siteConfig.customFields.xpackSubversion }.{ siteConfig.customFields.npmSubversion }</code>.

Since adherence of third party packages to semver is not guaranteed,
it is recommended to avoid referring to the OpenOCD dependency via
a semver expressions like <code>^{ siteConfig.customFields.upstreamVersion }</code> or
<code>~{ siteConfig.customFields.upstreamVersion }</code>, and prefer exact matches, like <code>{ siteConfig.customFields.upstreamVersion }-{ siteConfig.customFields.xpackSubversion }.{ siteConfig.customFields.npmSubversion }</code>.

## Drivers

### Windows drivers

Most JTAG probes require separate drivers on Windows.
For additional information, please refer to the
[Install Guide](/docs/install/) page.

### GNU/Linux UDEV subsystem

For the JTAG probes implemented as USB devices (actually most of them),
the last installation step on GNU/Linux is to configure the UDEV subsystem.
For additional information, please refer to the
[Install Guide](https://xpack.github.io/openocd/install/) page.

### macOS

On macOS, JTAG probes implemented as USB devices usually are
recognised directly and do not need explicit drivers.

## Shared libraries

On all platforms the packages are standalone, and expect only the standard
runtime to be present on the host.

All dependencies that are build as shared libraries are copied locally
in the `libexec` folder (or in the same folder as the executable for Windows).

### `DT_RPATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`

On GNU/Linux the binaries are adjusted to use a relative path:

```console
$ readelf -d library.so | grep runpath
 0x000000000000001d (RPATH)            Library rpath: [$ORIGIN]
```

In the GNU ld.so search strategy, the `DT_RPATH` has
the highest priority, higher than `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, so if this later one
is set in the environment, it should not interfere with the xPack binaries.

Please note that previous versions, up to mid-2020, used `DT_RUNPATH`, which
has a priority lower than `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, and does not tolerate setting
it in the environment.

### `@rpath` and `@loader_path`

Similarly, on macOS, the binaries are adjusted with `install_name_tool`
(part of CLT) to use a relative path.

## Using openocd in testing

OpenOCD provides a fairly good implementation of Arm semihosting
which can be used for automated testing. For this the application must
be build with full semihosting support.

:::note

The details of semihosted builds
are beyound the scope of this page.

:::

### CMake example

The easiest way to build automated test is with CMake in an xPack application.

Since on Windows the xPack OpenOCD uses `.cmd` forwarders, it is necessary
to explicitly define the extension, later used when invoking `openocd`:

```cmake
if("${CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME}" STREQUAL "Windows")
  set(extension ".cmd")
endif()
```

To run the test, the semihosted application must be first programmed
into the board and executed in an environment with semihosting enabled.

An example of such a test running on a STM32F4 board can be:

```cmake
if (ENABLE_RTOS_APIS_TEST)

  add_executable(rtos-apis-test)
  set_target_properties(rtos-apis-test PROPERTIES OUTPUT_NAME "rtos-apis-test")

  // ... definitions to build the application with semihosting support ...

  add_test(
    NAME "rtos-apis-test"

    COMMAND openocd${extension}
      # -d3
      -c "gdb_port disabled"
      -c "tcl_port disabled"
      -c "telnet_port disabled"
      -f interface/stlink-dap.cfg
      -f target/stm32f4x.cfg
      -c "program rtos-apis-test.elf verify"
      -c "arm semihosting enable"
      -c "arm semihosting_cmdline rtos-apis-test"
      -c "reset"
    )

endif ()
```

:::tip

The commands to disable the various ports are required to avoid
possible port collisions with other debug sessions or tests running
in parallel on other boards.

The commented out `-d3` is there for just in case something wrong
happens, to enable a detailed debug log.

:::

In an xPack application, the tests can be invoked by running an xPack action,
like this:

```sh
xpm run test
```

This asssumes that in `package.json` there is an action named `test`
and that all required tools were previously installed:

```json
{
  "...": "...",

  "xpack": {
    "actions": {
      "...": "...",
      "test": "ctest -V"
    },
    "devDependencies": {
      "@xpack-dev-tools/cmake": "3.26.5-1.1",
      "@xpack-dev-tools/ninja-build": "1.11.1-3.1",
      "@xpack-dev-tools/openocd": "0.12.0-3.1",
      "@xpack-dev-tools/arm-none-eabi-gcc": "12.3.1-1.2.1"
    }
  }
}
```

The xPack action runs the defined command (`ctest -V` in this case)
in an environment where `xpacks/.bin` is prepended to the PATH, so
the tools installed locally by **xpm** are available and prefered to
possibly other similar tools installed in the system, thus
achieving a good reproducibility.
