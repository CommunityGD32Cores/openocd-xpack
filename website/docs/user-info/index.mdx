This page is intended for those who plan
to use the OpenOCD binaries in their workflows.

## Versioning

The version string used by the OpenOCD project is a three number string
like <code>{ customFields.upstreamVersion }</code>; to this string the xPack distribution adds a four number,
but since semver allows only three numbers, all additional ones can
be added only as pre-release strings, separated by a dash,
like <code>{ customFields.upstreamVersion }-{ customFields.xpackSubversion }</code>. When published as a npm package, the version gets
a fifth number, like <code>{ customFields.upstreamVersion }-{ customFields.xpackSubversion }.{ customFields.npmSubversion }</code>.

Since adherence of third party packages to semver is not guaranteed,
it is recommended to avoid referring to the OpenOCD dependency via
a semver expressions like <code>^{ customFields.upstreamVersion }</code> or
<code>~{ customFields.upstreamVersion }</code>, and prefer exact matches, like <code>{ customFields.upstreamVersion }-{ customFields.xpackSubversion }.{ customFields.npmSubversion }</code>.

## Drivers

### Windows drivers

Most JTAG probes require separate drivers on Windows.
For additional information, please refer to the
[Install Guide](/docs/install/) page.

### GNU/Linux UDEV subsystem

For the JTAG probes implemented as USB devices (actually most of them),
the last installation step on GNU/Linux is to configure the UDEV subsystem.
For additional information, please refer to the
[Install Guide](https://xpack.github.io/openocd/install/) page.

### macOS

On macOS, JTAG probes implemented as USB devices usually are
recognised directly and do not need explicit drivers.

## Shared libraries

On all platforms the packages are standalone, and expect only the standard
runtime to be present on the host.

All dependencies that are build as shared libraries are copied locally
in the `libexec` folder (or in the same folder as the executable for Windows).

### `DT_RPATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`

On GNU/Linux the binaries are adjusted to use a relative path:

```console
$ readelf -d library.so | grep runpath
 0x000000000000001d (RPATH)            Library rpath: [$ORIGIN]
```

In the GNU ld.so search strategy, the `DT_RPATH` has
the highest priority, higher than `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, so if this later one
is set in the environment, it should not interfere with the xPack binaries.

Please note that previous versions, up to mid-2020, used `DT_RUNPATH`, which
has a priority lower than `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, and does not tolerate setting
it in the environment.

### `@rpath` and `@loader_path`

Similarly, on macOS, the binaries are adjusted with `install_name_tool` to use a
relative path.
