This page is intended for those who plan
to use the OpenOCD binaries in their workflows.

## Versioning

The version string used by the OpenOCD project is a three number string
like <code>{ customFields.version }</code>; to this string the xPack distribution adds a four number,
but since semver allows only three numbers, all additional ones can
be added only as pre-release strings, separated by a dash,
like <code>{ customFields.version }-{ customFields.xpack_subversion }</code>. When published as a npm package, the version gets
a fifth number, like <code>{ customFields.version }-{ customFields.xpack_subversion }.{ customFields.npm_subversion }</code>.

Since adherence of third party packages to semver is not guaranteed,
it is recommended to avoid referring to the OpenOCD dependency via
a semver expressions like <code>^{ customFields.version }</code> or
<code>~{ customFields.version }</code>, and prefer exact matches, like <code>{ customFields.version }-{ customFields.xpack_subversion }.{ customFields.npm_subversion }</code>.

## Drivers

### Windows drivers

Most JTAG probes require separate drivers on Windows.
For more details please read the
[Install](/docs/install/) page.

### GNU/Linux UDEV subsystem

For the JTAG probes implemented as USB devices (actually most of them),
the last installation step on GNU/Linux is to configure the UDEV subsystem.

For more details please read the
[Install](https://xpack.github.io/openocd/install/) page.

### macOS

On macOS, JTAG probes implemented as USB devices usually are
recognised directly and do not need explicit drivers.
