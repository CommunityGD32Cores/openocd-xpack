## Release schedule

In the past, the OpenOCD had no release schedule, and very rare
[releases](https://github.com/openocd-org/openocd/releases).
The xPack OpenOCD releases also had no schedules, and were done on an
as-needed basis. As a general rule, it is planned to follow the upstream
releases and add releases from the repo HEAD from time to time.
